Here are the STL files for 3D printing your own 503 Banglets

You may notice there is a soft and a hard version.  The soft design was the original design, and has a much more rubbery feel.  The reccomended filament for the soft design is the clear flexible filament from 3Dsolutech.com.  This can be a huge pain to print, so we also made a version of the banglet with a hinge.  This badge can be printed with regular PLA.

Once printed, you can glue magnets into the holes, and maybe put some 22 guage wire into the hinge if you printed the hard version.  We have also been using clear polyolefin heat shrink tubing to hold the electronics in place.

Suggested printer settings:
---------------------------
```
10% hexagonal infill
.2mm layer height
Bed temp: 55C
```

Big thanks to @jonhannis for leading this effort.
