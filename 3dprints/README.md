503 Banglet STL files
---------------------

You may notice there is a soft and a hard version.  The soft design was the original design, and has a much more rubbery feel.  The recommended filament for the soft design is the clear flexible filament from 3Dsolutech.com.  This can be a huge pain to print on most 3D printers, so we also made a version of the banglet with a hinge.  This banglet can be printed with standard PLA or ABS.

Once printed, you can press fit or glue magnets into the holes, depending on version printed, and maybe put some 22 gauge wire into the hinge if you printed the hard version.  We have also been using thin bands of 3/4" clear polyolefin heat shrink tubing to hold the electronics in place.

Recommended printer settings:
---------------------------
soft banglet:
```
0.2mm layer height
100% infill
230c extruder temp
```

hard banglet:
```
0.2mm layer height
10% hexagonal infill
230c extruder temp
55-90c bed temp (depends on filament)
```

Big thanks to @jonhannis for leading this effort.
