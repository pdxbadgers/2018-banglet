Here are the STL files for 3D printing your own 503 Banglets.

You may notice there is a soft and a hard version.  The soft design was the original design, and has a much more rubbery feel.  The reccomended filament for the soft design is the clear flexible filament from 3Dsolutech.com.  This can be a huge pain to print, so we also made a version of the banglet with a hinge.  This badge can be printed with regular PLA.
