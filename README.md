DEFCON 26 DC503 VIP Banglet
---------------------------
Here we are, another crazy year, another crazy party badge.  Necks are so over-used, so this year we're migrating to the wrist.  The idea is a fully functional bluetooth recon device with multiple, um, "hidden" party modes on the bleuart (like, UART over bluetooth, crazy right?) service.
